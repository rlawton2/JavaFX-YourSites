## Description
An applicaiton that stores and allows access to your favorite websites.

## Project Details
The project has a UI created with JavaFX. The application loads specific websites depending on the catagory selected. The user then uses the combo box to select a website. In the future I would like to add a feature for users to customize the websites. Currently, the application just reads from a file predetermined websites.
