![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlawton2/JavaFX-YourSites/master/Banner3.png)

## Description
This NetBeans project demonstates the use of the factory design pattern and some class hierarchy.

## Project Details
The factory design allows objects to be created at runtime without knowing what the exact class of the object will be. It utilizes a parent class or interface as a reference type and a "factory" class to determine the class the object. Also, in the program are some examples of downcasting and coversion to child reference types. This could be useful if you would like to store the objects in specific collections, etc.

This is a project I created with JavaFX. I plan to add more to the project at a later date, but wanted to test my ability to create this application. What this program does is load specific websites and allows to the user to select a website using a combo box.

In the future I plan to add to section for users to be able to customize available websites.
