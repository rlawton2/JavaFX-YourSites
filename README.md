![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlawton2/JavaFX-YourSites/master/Banner3.png)

## Description
This NetBeans project demonstates the use of the factory design pattern and some class hierarchy.

## Project Details
This is a project I created with JavaFX. I plan to add more to the project at a later date, but wanted to test my ability to create this application. What this program does is load specific websites and allows to the user to select a website using a combo box.
